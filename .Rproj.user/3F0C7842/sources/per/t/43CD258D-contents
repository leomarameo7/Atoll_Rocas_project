## Introduction

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>. 

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars,echo=FALSE}
summary(cars)
n_linha = nrow(cars)
```

Este banco de dados é uma tabela com `r n_linha`

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
A tabela 1 é a seguinte 
```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(knitr)
kable(iris, format = 'pandoc', caption = 'Tabela especies florais')

```
