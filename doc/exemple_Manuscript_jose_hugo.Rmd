abstract:  In order to achieve a better understanding of the complex interactions in the estuarine environment, a steady-state trophic model (for the year 2014) was constructed using the Ecopath with Ecosim software to assess the fisheries impacts on structure and functioning of a subtropical estuarine system. According to the fishing gear were categorized five fleets. The results show that the values of effective trophic level ranged from 1.00 to 3.79. The average trophic transfer efficiency was much closer to the theoretical value of 10%, and 42% of the energy flows originated from the detritus chain, while 58% originated from the grazing. The PEC was considered in the early stage of maturation according to the Odum theory since the primary production was much higher to respiration and biomass. Whereas, the connectance, the omnivory index, and recycling index, they presented values within the expected for subtropical estuaries. The primary production required (PPR), Gross efficiency and L-index indicate that the impact of fishing on the trophic structure was low, and was most evident in the gillnet fisheries.

# Introduction

Estuaries are one of the most productive, dynamic, and exploited ecosystems in the world. Because of their constant changes, it is a hard task to distinguish the effects between natural cycles (environmental stressors) and the anthropic impacts on this ecosystem [@Barbier2011; @Boerema2017]. In these ecosystems, fishing plays an important and complex role as anthropogenic drivers [@Barbier2011; @Blaber2013; @Sheaves2014]. Fishing impacts may reflect both the target resource and non-target resources, including changes in their abundances, the age structure, the biometrics, and the change in the nursery functions that these ecosystems have for many species. In detail, fishery change food webs, since they remove or reduce organisms from several trophic levels (e.g., predators or prey), disrupting the natural interactions, and may promote the increase of organic matter due to bycatch in these areas [@Blaber2000; @Blaber2000a]. Although there is much information on marine and oceanic about fisheries impacts, relatively little research has been undertaken on fisheries within estuaries, and data are very patchy [@Blaber2016].

Because of these complexities, and the need to move forward to adopt integrative approaches to maintain sustainable levels of fishing impacts without considerable changes on ecosystems structure and functioning [@Larkin1996; @Garcia2003; @Trochta2018], ecological models have become very useful tools to achieve this goal [@Plaganyi2007], especially models representing the fisheries impacts on food webs [@Colleter2015]. In this sense, Ecopath with Ecosim (EwE) approach has been advanced recently, especially in marine environments [@Colleter2015]. Nevertheless, in estuarine systems [@Lira2018] and more specifically in subtropical estuaries, the impact of fishing is still poorly evaluated [@Lercari2015; @Han2016].

Although the socioecological importance of the estuaries [@Barbier2011; @Blaber2013; @Sheaves2014; @Boerema2017], few models seek to assess the trophic structure in these ecosystems, and how fishing can affect it [@Colleter2015; @Lira2018]. In subtropical estuaries, such studies have been even less frequent [@Lin2007; @Duan2009b; @Du2015; @Han2016]. In the southeast Atlantic, estuarine food webs models were concentrated in the tropical region, but in these cases, the effects of fishing on the structure and functioning of the system have not been evaluated [@Wolff2000; @Xavier2013; @Lira2018]. The studies of @Lercari2015 in the La Plata estuary is one of the few that attempt to describe the impact of fishing on a subtropical estuarine system.

Using the Ecopath approach, in this paper we developed a food web model of the Paranaguá Estuary Complex (PEC). The PEC model was calibrated using a short landing time series (2014-2018), which contributed to understanding the role of fishing in the ecosystem structure. Our simulations tested several scenarios to evaluate the fishing impacts on the main target species and on the ecosystem.

# Methods

##	The study area

The Paranaguá Estuarine Complex - PEC (Figure \@ref(fig:mapa)) is a subtropical and rich-nutrient ecosystem of southern Brazil, where plankton and mangrove detritus dominate the organic metabolism in this system. It covers a flooded area of 612 km^2 and formed of two main embayments: 1) North-south axis, 30 km long and 13 km wide; and 2) East-west axis, 50 km long and 7 km wide [@Marone2005]. There are a great diversity of habitats, including mangroves, salt marshes, rocky shores, islands, shoals (vegetated and not vegetated), providing the complexity of the environment and biodiversity [@Lana2001]. The climate is humid subtropical with hot and rainy summer, and dry winter with mean water temperature ranges from 23 to 30°C (summer) and from 18 to 25°C (winter), and horizontal seawater gradient of salinity reaching a maximum range of 0 to 30 ppm in the summer. The tide cycle is semi-diurnal, with tidal amplitude ranching 2.7m in upstream and 1.7m in downstream [@Marone2005].
This estuary is an example of socio-ecological systems because it is recognized as a world heritage site due to its ecological importance and, where were established a set of  Conservation Units. Paranaguá Estuarine Complex is an area of breeding, nursery and feeding of a wide variety of marine and brackish species, including many fisheries resources [ @Passos2012a; @Possatto2017], dolphins [@Sasaki2010; @Miranda2017], turtles [@Barrera2009], and seabirds [@Gomes2010]. At the same time, there are anthropogenic activities around the bay, including harbor/ports, tourism, and small-scale fisheries [@Possatto2017]. Unfortunately, biological studies are scarce, and information regarding the fishing impacts are unknown, especially on the ecosystem level.

knitr::include_graphics("Mapa_oficial.jpeg")

```

The fisheries in the PEC area has high fishing gears diversity and low technological level, and main fishing targets are shrimps, crabs, bivalve mollusks and several fish species [@Andriguetto-Filho2009]. The fishing spots are near to the coast,  and landings performed in many fishing communities around the PEC [@Andriguetto-Filho2006]. The fisher’s family uses the fisheries resources for subsistence and sell another part, or for the final consumer (e.g., tourists), or supply local restaurants, or for the fish market [@PortosdoParana2019].

Briefly, the management measures for the PEC fisheries deal with: fishing license; fishing areas closed; prohibition of gears (motorized trawl fishery) or restriction gear mesh size; prohibition to catch endangered species ad biometric restrictions (minimum size of catch, @ICMBio2018; @Medeiros2013b)

Commonly, the small-scale fisheries are carried out in wood or fiberglass vessels, with low load capacity (< ton) and motorization (< 22HP), with familial relationships [@Andriguetto-Filho2009]. In the development of our PEC model, was considered five fleets by gear type, as follows: Artisanal Mollusks Fishery (AMF), Estuarine Trap Fishery (ETF), Estuarine Trap Fishery (ETF), Gillnets Fishery (GNF), and Longline Fishery (LLF). A brief description of these fishing fleets is in Supplementary Material (Table S1, Section 1).



## Mass-balance Ecoapath modeling approach

The Ecopath with Ecosim - EwE ([www.ecopath.org](http://www.ecopath.org) pproach allows the elaboration of mass balance models in order to understand the trophic relationships and consequently the ecosystem functioning [@Christensen2008]. It was initially created by @Polovina1984b, aIt was initially created by Polovina (1984), and it has been continuously developed since 1992 [@Christensen1992a].  The mass balance for any group (i) expresses the balance between the factors that increase its biomass (production, consumption, immigration) and the ones that decrease it (fishing, predation, other mortality). This balance can be expressed by:


\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:7}
  B_i \cdot \left(\dfrac{P}{B} \right)_i \cdot EE_i - \displaystyle \sum_{j=1}^{i}B_j \cdot \left ( \dfrac{Q}{B} \right)_j \cdot DC_{ji} - EX_i = 0
\end{equation}

Where: $B_i$ and $PB_i$ respectively indicate the biomass (ton km^-2^) and the production per unit of the biomass ton km^-2^ year^-1^ of a group $i$. the $EE_i$ iis the ecotrophic efficiency, which represents the part of the production of the group that is transferred to higher trophic levels and removed by fishing. $B_j$ and $QB_j$, respectively, indicate the biomass and the consumption per the unit of the biomass of predatorss (j). The DCji is the fraction (%) of (i) in the diet of (j); EXi is the export of (i) and represents the fishing biomass and migrates. Functional groups may be composed by a single, or a group os species which share similar life-history.

## General description of input data

Our PEC model represents the 2014’s year, and it has 39 functional groups which include: one marine mammal, four seabirds, one marine turtles, 19 fish, eight benthic and two pelagic invertebrates, and four primary producers groups, besides one detritus. These groups are the main trophic components of the ecosystem and include all fishing target species in the area.

Data used to parameterize the values for the model were mainly compiled from literature, digital database, and direct measurements. Inputs to the model were standardized to wet weight (ton km^-2^). A detailed description of EwE groups, length-weight-growth data, estimation methods, diet matrix, and references used to build the PEC Ecopath model could be seen below and in Supplementary Material (Section 2).

### Biomass

For marine mammals and seabirds, the biomass estimates derived from abundance surveys [@Miranda2017; @PortosdoParana2019], combined with individual mean body mass obtained from literature(@Rosas2003b) and virtual databases (@Life2018).

For fishes groups, catfishes and pufferfishes, the biomass was estimated by the swept area method [@Possatto2017],but this estimation method was not applied to all the groups because in some cases they were not captured by trawl (sampling method) or their biomasses were underestimated due to gear's selectivity. In these cases, the biomass estimated by the trawl method presented values lower than the fishing landings, and the application of the catch coefficients [@Lauretta2013] did not present consistent results. Therefore, we chose, especially for high trophic level fishes, to determine the biomass from an estimate of the exploitation rate (E) and consequently, the fishing mortality (F). The E ratio values were pre-established based on the knowledge of local fishers interviewed using a structured questionnaire (with some fishers from fishing communities). The E values ranged from 20-30% for groups of high TL and high commercial interest. For the other fish (medium and low trophic levels) and invertebrates groups, we chose the estimates generated by the EwE.

The phytoplankton biomass was calculated using local estimates of chlorophyll-a concentration (2.0 to 6.0 mg Chl-a, @Marone2005) and adjacent coastal waters (0.02 to 10.8, @Brandini2007). We adopted a mean concentration of 5 mg chl-a and the ratios used for conversion were: chl-a to mg C = 30 [@Strickland1960] and mg C to mg WW =16 [@Walsh1981], and the mean depth assumed was 5.0 meters. Detritus was calculated using the empirical formula of @Pauly1983, relating detrital biomass to primary production and euphotic layer depth. The zooplankton biomass, the macroalgae and the seagrass had their biomasses estimated by the model, from the minimum acceptable value (0.95) for ecotrophic efficiency (E.E).

### Production

We applied Hoening's equation (Equation \ref{eq:6}) for marine mammals [@Araujo2011] to estimate total mortality (Z):


\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:6}
  \ln (Z) = 0.941 \cdot 0.873 \cdot \ln (Maximum-age)\
\end{equation}

Where: maximum age of 30 years for *Sotalia guianensis* was determined by @Rosas2003b. For all seabirds, P/B was defined as 0.25 ton km^-2^ year^-1^ [@Araujo2011; @Bergamino2012], while for turtles, the production was obtained from other Ecoapth models [@Angelini2018; @Lira2018; @Opitz1996].

For fishes groups P/B parameters were estimated based on total mortality ($Z = M + F$): the total mortality rates (M) were calculated by empirical equation [@Pauly1980b], and the F ratio was calculated from pre-established exploitation ratio (Table \@ref(tab:pesca)). For shrimps, P/B was obtained in @Villela1997 and @Carvalho2013, for crabs in @Shinozaki-Mendes2017. For all others invertebrates, including zooplankton, $P/B$ values derived from other models [@Angelini2018; @Lira2018 @Opitz1996]. 

The P/B of phytoplankton was estimated based on primary productivity reported by @Kampel2003 for adjacent coastal waters. For other primaries producers, the P/B was derived from other models: seagrass [@Walters2008] and macro-algae [@Freire2008].

### Consumption

The daily ratio (DR) consumption of Guiana dolphins was calculated from the empirical equation [@Innes1987]:

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:4}
(DR) = 0.1 \cdot W ^{0.8}  
\end{equation}

Where W = mean body mass, and both, DR and W expressed in kilograms. Diary rate (DR) for seabirds were determined by the empirical equation of @Nilsson1976:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:5}
  \log(DR) = -0.293 + 0.850\log(W)
\end{equation}

Where W = mean body mass and both DR and W expressed grams. For both mammals and seabirds, daily ratio consumptions were converted to annual rates considering the biomass of their population. For other non-fish groups, Q/B ratios were obtained from the literature [@Opitz1996;@Catherine2010a; @Lira2018].

For fishes groups, Q/B were calculates using the empirical equation described by @Palomares1998a.

### Diet Matrix

The diet matrix was built using published data, including articles, thesis, and digital databases [@Arantes2014; @Chaves2008, see others references in Supplementary material]. Priority was given to diet assessments from the study area or adjacent areas for the same species. If these categories were not available, information from similar areas and similar species used (see the diet matrix in Table S7 and S8, Section 2; Supplementary Material).

### Fisheries

The landings data for the small-scale fishery were obtained from a local monthly monitoring program  [@PortosdoParana2019] between 2014 and 2018. Some groups had their catch rates adjusted from new monitoring programs, for example, the snooks, pampo and grunts, and the large reef fish and  [@FUNDEPAG2018], and information about discards (general demersal fish), turtles and dolphins were estimated based on the knowledge of local fishers.

## Model analyses and ecosystem indicators

### Assessing the quality of model input estimates and balancing the model 

Input data quality was assessed using the Ecopath Pedigree routine. In this routine, the user classifies the data by choosing values between 0 (low quality) and 1 (high quality) for each input parameter ($B$, $PB$,$QB$, and diet data) according to the information source. Then, the average value for all parameters and groups provides a general, and concise index of the model input data quality [@Morissette2007; @Christensen2008]. We also utilized, in order to calibrate the model and to trust it, the best practices in Ecopath modeling [@Jacomina2016a]: i) before running the model we increased the non-assimilated consumption ratio for zooplankton from 20% to 40%, and for benthos groups and other groups feeding on phytoplankton from 20% to 30% (physiologically realistic); (ii) the model was balanced to Ecotropic Efficiency (E.E) values to be lower than 1.0 changing diet composition matrix firstly; iii). we also confirmed if GE (Gross Efficiency or $P/Q$) values were between 0.1 and 0.3; iv) The Respiration/Assimilation ratio ($R/A$) needs to be < 1.0; vi) Respiration/Biomass rate values between 1 to 10 for fish compartments and higher for groups with higher metabolic rates, and vii) Net Efficiency needs to be higher than GE. The Pre-Balanced (PREBAL) diagnosis [@Link2010] to assess issues of the model structure, was used to assess issues of the model structure, among them, the order of magnitude that the biomass reaches, and if $B$, $PB$ and $QB$ decrease with the $PB$ increase of trophic levels.

###	Ecosystem structure, maturity, flows and fishing impacts

Functional groups of the PEC model were aggregated at a discrete trophic level and represented by the Lindeman spine analysis [@Lindeman1942; @Libralato2010; @Corrales2015]. This analysis also allows to calculate the Transfer Efficiency (TE, %) of the flows between trophic levels and represents the fraction of the total flow of a trophic level that is consumed by the immediately superior TL. The mTE is the geometric mean of transfer efficiencies for trophic level II to IV. The structure, functioning, stage of development of the ecosystem were analyzed in terms of trophic flows, thermodynamics, information theory, and trophodynamic indicators [@Ulanowicz1986; @Christensen1995].

The mixed trophic impact analysis ($MTI_{ij}$) [@Ulanowicz1990; @Christensen2008] identifies the relative impact (direct or indirect) that a hypothetical increase in the biomass of one group (i), including fishing fleets, would produce on the biomass of other groups (j). From $MTI_i$ analysis it is possible to obtain the overall effect, $\epsilon_i$ (Equation \ref{eq:3}), which can be expressed to be related to the maximum effect measured in the food web, excluding the effect on itself.


\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:3}
  \epsilon_i = \displaystyle\sqrt{\sum_{j \neq i}^{N} m_{ij}^{2}}
\end{equation}


The low biomass groups with a structuring role in the food web are defined as keystone species. The Keystoneness ($KS_i$) of a functional group is defined as: 

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:2}
KS_i = log \left ( \epsilon_i {(1-p_i)}\right) 
\end{equation}

Where $p_i$ is the contribution of each functional group i to the total biomass of the food web.

In order to consider the fishing effects in the PEC, a series of fishing-related indicators were included to assess the exploitation status, including the relative primary production required to sustain the fisheries ($PPR$%), the mean trophic level of the catch ($TL_c$), and the gross efficiency of the fishery ($GE$, catch/NetPP).

The loss in secondary production due to fishing ($L_{index}$) takes in account both the ecosystem properties described above (Equation \ref{eq:7}) to quantify the loss of total secondary production due to fishing, as a proxy for quantifying its impact. A meta-analysis of 51 ecological models ecosystems previously classified as overexploited or sustainably exploited, allows the association of a probability of the ecosystem being sustainably fished ($P_{sust}$) with each index value [@Libralato2008].


\begin{equation}
\label{eq:7}
L_{index} = {-}\frac {PPR \cdot TE^{TL_c-1}}{PP \cdot \ln(TE)}
\end{equation}

## Simulating temporal dynamics

After the static model, Ecopath envolved with a time simulation (Ecosim) in 1995 [@Walters1997], enabling dynamics modeling to explore the impacts of environmental disturbances. In this way, Ecopath is one of the most widely used fishery ecosystem modeling tools in the World and has been applied in the most diverse ecological ecosystems [@Colleter2015;@Christensen2008].

The dynamic module of the EwE uses settings from the mass-balance module to estimate temporal biomass flows [@Walters1997; @Walters2008]. Ecosim works with a set of differential equations to estimate biomass flows for each functional group, as follow:


\begin{equation}
 \label{eq:8}
 \frac{dB_i}{dt} = {g_i} \cdot \sum Q_{ji} - \sum Q_{ji} + I_i - (MO_i +F_i + \epsilon_i) \cdot B_i
\end{equation},

where $dB_{i}/dt$ is the biomass growth rate of group (i) during the interval $dt$, $g_i$ is the net growth efficiency (production/consumption ratio), $I_i$ is the immigration rate, $M_i$ and $F_i$ are natural and fishing mortality rates of group (i), $e_i$ is emigration rate and $B_i$ the biomass . The consumption rates, $Q_{ij}$ (Equation \ref{eq:9}), are calculated based on the foraging arena concept [@Ahrens2012], in which prey biomasses are divided into vulnerable and invulnerable states which sets the maximum increase in predation mortality a given predator can cause on a given prey. which determines whether the flow control is top-down ($v_{ij}$ > 2), bottom-up ($v_{ij}$ < 2), or mixed ($v_{ij}$ = 2; the defaults values in EwE).

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:9}
Q_{ij} = \frac{a_{ij} \cdot v_{ij} \cdot B_i \cdot P_j}{2 \cdot a_{ij} \cdot P_{j}}
\end{equation}

where $a_{ij}$ is the effective search rate (time of search by the area or volume of the foraging arena) of predator j feeding on prey i, $B_i$ is the biomass of the prey, $P_j$ is the biomass of predator, and $v_{ij}$ is the vulnerability of prey i to predator j.

### Calibration

Before being used to make predictions, the Ecosim model was calibrated using landing times series from 2014 – 2018 [@PortosdoParana2019]. The fitting time series was carried out using an integrated plug-in, the Stepwise Fitting Procedure [@Scott2016]. This tool automatically searches for the best fit model to observed data by testing a set of hypotheses to assess the impact of fishing (through fishing mortality/effort time series), changes in the predator-prey dynamics (vulnerability settings), and changes in primary production [@Philippsen2019], with the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). We used fishing effort data (number of landing operations) for each fleet as the driving factor to fit the observed catch data from 2014 to 2018 [@PortosdoParana2019].


### Simulating future scenarios

After the model was fitted to data, we developed several temporal simulations until 2033 (15 years) to assess any possible change in ecosystem characteristics due to changes in fishing effort. We adopted the fishing effort from 2018 as a baseline (S1) and simulated scenarios increasing fishing effort by 25% (S2), 50% (S3), and 100% (S4), as well as reduced fishing effort by 50% (S5). The changes were simultaneous and in the same proportion for all fishing fleets, and kept constant between 2019 and 2033.

We addressing the uncertainty of simulations with the Monte Carlo routine, where 250 iterations were developed, modifying the input parameters as from a normal distribution centered on the base value of Ecopath and using 10% confidence interval (EwE default) [@Piroddi2017]. The range of outputs (the 5% and 95%) were plotted for both the outputs of the simulations (biomasses).

A test of significance of the trends of ecological indices (Total biomass, the trophic level upper excluding TL I - TLco >2 – trophic level of community with TL > 3.25, and Kempton's Q, which shows the biomass diversity for TL> 3) (TL of catches was conducted for the adjustment periods (2014 - 2018) and simulation (2018 - 2033). Due to the relatively short period  (n = 4 years for the fitting period and n= 15 years for simulation period), a linear trend the high autocorrelation model was fit to each one of the simulations using a generalized least squares regression framework  [@Coll2008, @Philippsen2019]. 



# Results

## Functional groups, parametrization and data quality
The initial input values for the PEC model (Table \@ref(tab:tab1)) were modified in order to balance the model and to respect restrictions physiologic (several rates and PRE-BAL analyses, see Supplementary Material, Section 3).

## Trophic Structure and Flows

The highest trophic level value was `r round(newe$TL[3],2)` for piscivore seabird I. The total biomass, excluding detritus, was `r round(tab2b[14,2], 2)` ton km^-2^, which invertebrates accounted for about 35.6%, with emphasis on zooplankton, crabs, sessile fauna, and shrimps. The fish represents 32.5% and Primary Producers 30.8% of the total biomass. While mammals, seabirds, and turtles together account for approximately 1% (Table \@ref(tab:tab1), also in Figuere S2, Section 4, Supplementar Material).

The most prominent flow was the link between the Primary Producers and TL II, mainly due to zooplankton grazing on phytoplankton. Furthermore, sessile fauna and bivalves, both with high biomass groups with high consumption of phytoplankton, contributed to lower detritivory/herbivory ratio (0.63) (Figure \@ref(fig:lindeman)). Flow originated in detritus was important for other invertebrates and some fishes, like mugelids and catfishes. The overall mean transfer efficiency was 12.6%. With similar values for grazing chain and detritus chain (12% and 12.9%, respectively ) (Figure \@ref(fig:lindeman)).


```{r lindeman, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Detritus-based and grazing-based flow diagram of the Paranaguá Estuarine Complex - PEC ecosystem organized by four trophic levels (TL) in the form of a modified Lindeman spine.", out.width = '100%', fig.pos="H"}
knitr::include_graphics("lindman.jpg")
```

The TL I (primary producers and detritus) generated 87% of TST (ton/km²/year) with high flow to detritus from primary producers and high exports by detritus pathway. Proportionally, the consumption is higher in grazing-based chains, although their importance along with trophic levels similarly decreases in both. From TL II, flows by respiration becomes the largest, followed by flow into detritus (Figure \@ref(fig:barplot)).

```{r barplot, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="The proportion of main energy flow in the total system throughput for each trophic level in the PEC model (Brazil)", fig.height=2.5, fig.pos="H", fig.width=5, warning=FALSE}

mtext('Total System Troughput (%)', side = 2, outer = TRUE, line = 2, cex= 1)


```

Ecosystem attributes (Table \@ref(tab:tab2)) show that PEC is a developing ecosystem. In terms of PPR to sustain the consumption of functional groups, zooplankton was the higher (7,2%), and among the fish, the GDF (4%) and catfish (3.3%) presented the highest values, close to those obtained by the cormorant (3.1%).

## Mixed Trophic Impacts and Keystoness Index
The analysis of MTI (Figure \@ref(fig:mti)) revealed the competitive interactions between functional groups with a similar trophic level. In general, primary producers had positive impacts on all groups, and it could reveal a bottom-up control mechanism on PEC. The Keystoneness analysis showed that the Guiana dolphins, the cormorant, and general demersalfish have an essential role in the ecosystem's trophic structure.

knitr::include_graphics("MTI.jpg")
```


## Fishery impacts

The total catch of the model was `r round(tab2b[15,2], 2)` ton km^-2^ year^-1^, with commercial landings represented 92.2% and bycatch with 0.05 ton km^-2^ year^-1^. The mean trophic level of catches (TLc) was `r round(tab2b[7,2], 2)`. The gillnet fisheries fleet (GLF) accounted for 41% of the biomass landed and the most heterogeneous gears to target species. Estuarine trap fishery (ETF) accounts for 35% of total landings, shared in blue crabs (66%) and the remaining pufferfishes (34%). The artisanal mollusks fishery (AMF) and the estuarine shrimp's fishery (ESF) exploit only one group each and account for 14% and 4%, respectively, while longline fishery (LLF) contributes with 5% of the total landing. Discards were identified only in the GLF fleet, and represent 27% of the total catch of this fleet, being in the most significant fraction of turtles, general demersal fishes, and rays (Table \@ref(tab:pesca)).



\begin{singlespace}
```{r pesca, echo=FALSE, includes= FALSE}

kable_styling(latex_options = c("repeat_header"),font_size=8)
```
\end{singlespace}


The primary production required to sustain the fisheries in PEC was 47.9 ton km^-2^ year^-1^, which is equivalent to 0.67% of total primary production, taking into account the primary producers together with detritus. The catfishes (0.20%), Guiana dolphin (0,08%), the medium and large hakes (0.06%), and the flatfishes (0,04%) showed the highest PPR values (Table \@ref(tab:pesca)). The gross efficiency value was low (GE = 0.0001). Two fishing fleets, ESF and AMF, do not present any relevant impacts in any functional group, not even in the target species of these fisheries (Figure \@ref(fig:mti)). The $L_{index}$ index (0.004) resulted in a probability of 95% of this activity on the ecosystem has been sustainable ($P_{sust}$).

## Fitting Time Series

The stepwise fitting routine found the best fit for the Ecosim model when only the fishing effort was considered, maintaining the mixed (default values) effect vulnerabilities (v = 2) for all interactions. This fitting produced minimum values of sums of squares deviation (SS = 11.45), and the lowest AICs (-185.52).

Using the “best” fitted model, Ecosim reproduced the biomasses trends for commercial groups with available landing data (Figure \@ref(fig:fitting)). Specifically, croakers, GDF, and bivalves showed a good fit. There was no clear trend for the total biomass, TLc, TLco > 2, and TLco > 3.25 for the fitting period. While significant trends (p < 0.05) were observed on the increase of target species biomass, and decrease of Kempton’s Q index  (Figure \@ref(fig:indicadores)).


```{r fitting, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Fitting time series for commercial groups in the PEC model. Catch observed (points) and predicted (line) by EwE model. The catch is in tons/km²", fig.pos="H",out.width = '100%', warning=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("calibration.jpeg")

```

The simulations performed under scenarios with increase and decrease of fishing effort resulted in some changes in ecological indicators. The baseline scenario and the scenario with an increase of 25% fishing effort did not show significant trends of change for any index analyzed. The total biomass and biomass of commercial species did not present significant differences in any scenarios (Figure \@ref(fig:indicadores) A and B). The scenarios with 50% and 100% of fishing effort’s increase show negative trends in $TL_c$, Kempton’s Q index and $TL_{co}$ > 3.25 (Figure \@ref(fig:indicadores) C, D, and F). The reduction of 50% of fishing effort scenario shows significant trends only for increase of the trophic level of community with TL > 2 (Figure \@ref(fig:indicadores) E).

knitr::include_graphics("Indicadores.jpeg")

```

In the simulated scenarios, the higher trophic level functional groups responded directly to the increase or reduction of fishing effort (Figure \@ref(fig:simulation1)). The catfishes group was also sensitive to the changes in fishing effort even with lower trophic level to the others. Other groups such as croakers, and pampo and grunts also present a similar pattern but less sensitivity to the fishing effort (Figure \@ref(fig:simulation1)).

knitr::include_graphics("Figura1.jpeg")
```


Otherwise, some groups responded inversely to the fishing effort. In these cases, the scenario with a 100% increase of the effort reported the higher biomass increase: omnivores, pufferfishes, and mugelids (Figure \@ref(fig:simulation2)). For the other functional groups, in particular, the invertebrates and some demersal groups, the biomass along the simulated scenarios do not show apparent changes at the end of the period. In these cases, the values predicted by the simulations were very close to one another, and high overlapping of the variations of the scenarios, determined by the Monte Carlo simulations, occurred. The simulation for all groups is in Figure S3, Section 5 (Supplementary Material).

```{r simulation2, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Biomasses simulated by the Ecosim model for examples of groups that responded positively to the increase in fishing effort (14.

```


Scenarios also were simulated for megafauna groups (often captured as bycatch), although there were no adjusted time series. The turtles responded linearly to changes in fishing effort. This response was not very obvious for *Sotalia guianensis* (Figure \@ref(fig:simulation3)).

# Discussion

## Paranaguá Estuarine Complex Model

Our results indicate that the Paranaguá Estuarine Complex (PEC) model has a high primary production, which supports a grazing-based foodweb, with a low connectivity between functional groups, an high value (for estuarine systems) of the omnivory index, and a degree of recycling in the ecosystem lower than 10%, classifying it as a subtropical estuary [@Lira2018], in the early stages of the ecosystem development [@Christensen1995;@Odum1969; @Ulanowicz1986]. The fishing impact has a low impact on the structure and functioning of the food webs in the static perspective (Ecopath). However, fishing simulations with modifications in fleets effort (Ecosim) showed that high trophic levels groups are more sensitive and respond more directly to the increase or reduction of the fishing effort. Therefore, the model proposed in this study contributed to the understanding of the trophic relationships in subtropical estuaries, allowing the evaluation of the possible impacts of the fisheries.

Regarding parameterization, the PEC model has half of the biomass values estimated by the Ecopath. However, for high Trophic Level groups (dolphins, seabirds, and some fish groups), the biomasses values were determined by local assessments or estimated using an exploitation rate (E). In the area, the ichthyological surveys are conducted mainly by trawl technique [@Barletta2008; @Possatto2017], and therefore restricted to areas with depth and habitat suitable [@Spach2004]. Many commercial species captured in the local [@PortosdoParana2019; @FUNDEPAG2018] were not sampled by scientific surveys, which reduces the capacity of the application of catchability coefficient [@Lauretta2013]. This challenge in the survey of quantitative data is known in estuaries [@Blaber2002] and may be related to the diversity of habitats within them

However, the biomass values and the trophic level position of the functional groups of the PEC model (even those estimated indirectly) are consistent with the similar functional groups observed in other estuarine models [@Angelini2018;@Lira2018;@Dutta2017;@Han2016;@Lercari2015; @Xavier2013; @Duan2009b]. The practice of using estimates based on local knowledge has shown to be a helpful tool for scars information areas [@Bevilacqua2016; @StriederPhilippsen2017]. Besides, the Pedigree value was considered acceptable, since it was within the range of observed values in other models, and close to the global average [@Morissette2007]. 
The PREBAL routine [@Link2010; @Jacomina2016a] and the estimate of several rates indicate that PEC model has coherent ecological and physiological aspects (Figure S1, Section 3, Supplementary Material) and we can trust on its outputs.



## Ecosystem structure and flows of Paranaguá Estuarine Complex Food-web

The presence of seabirds and marine mammals the push TL values to reach a higher range than observed in other estuarine models in the tropical region [@Lira2018; @Xavier2013], but lower than others observed in subtropical estuaries [@Wolff2006; @Lercari2015; @Han2016; @Dutta2017], due to the presence of sharks, rays or a greater variety of marine mammal groups. 

Moreover, the biomass of the ecosystem is dominated by benthic fauna (~40%), organisms with high dependence of detritus. It is therefore expected that the flow from this source would prevail over grazing pathway, a natural characteristic in estuaries [@Xu2011a; @Rybarczyk2003;@Monaco1997 ]. Indeed there is a high input of the detritus from mangroves (plants debris) around the PEC, and the organic matter from the river drainage and anthropogenic sources.

However, the model revealed a low Detritivore: Herbivorie ratio, because of the strong phytoplankton-zooplankton coupling and also by the high biomass, or high production of plankton filtering functional groups such as bivalve and sessile fauna (barnacles and corals and anemones). This feature was also observed in Yangtse estuary (0.71) [@Han2016], Rio de La Plata estuary (0.60) [@Lercari2015], Gulf of Nicoya [@Wolff2006], and Caeté estuary (0.53) (Wolff, 2006). The mean TE for the study area was close to the overall average of 10% estimated by @Pauly1995.

The MTI analysis allowed to identify multiple effects (mixing control) described by @Cury1995 within the estuary: food chain base groups (phytoplankton, detritus, zooplankton, and benthic invertebrates) provoked positive impacts on the trophic levels above, indicating a possible bottom-up control. Moreover, top-down effects are acting because Guiana dolphins, cormorants, and piscivore seabird I affect negatively intermediate trophic levels and consequently have indirect positive impacts on invertebrates. The Keystoness analysis reinforces the role of phytoplankton for bottom-up control, while Guiana dolphins and cormorants for top-down control [@Libralato2006]


## Fisheries Impacts
The mean trophic level of the catch (mTLc; 2.71) of all fisheries in PEC system is similar to that obtained from the La Plata estuary [@Lercari2015], Bay of Benguela [@Dutta2017], and Sirinhanhem River [@Lira2018]. This indicator reflects the composition of catches, where benthic invertebrates predominate (mainly crabs, shrimps, and mollusks).

Fleets as GLF and LLF had TLc values above the general mTLc. The ESF and AMF gears showing lower values because explore just one single compartment, even ETF fleet exploits two resources (crabs and pufferfishes) and presents mTLc near the overall mean. The total catch of the ecosystem was low compared to other estuaries. The estuary Yangtse [@Han2016] and estuary La Plata were the ones with the closest values (0.980 ton km^-2^ year^-1^ and 1.16 km^-2^ year^-1^ respectively). Other Brazilian estuaries in the North and Northeast presented much higher values: Caeté Estuary (18.3 ton km^-2^ year^-1^), Mamanguape Estuary (7.37 km^-2^ year^-1^), and Sirinhanhem River Estuary (9.57 km^-2^ year^-1^) [@Lira2018 ]. In these models, the inclusion of mangrove crabs seems to influence total catches strongly. The low technification of the fishing gears may explain the low total catch compared to the other estuaries [@Andriguetto-Filho2006; @Andriguetto-Filho2009]. Other factors may be related to the size, presence of specific fishing grounds for some fleets (AMF, ESF, and ETF occur only in the shallow areas of the estuary), and the existence of fishing exclusion areas due to ships traffic and harbor activity. The fisheries have low bycatch rates, occurring only in the GLF fleet, whereas incidental catches of Guiana dolphins and the turtles occur, plus some fish with no commercial value that might be captured together with the target resource (e.g., SPF and GDF). 

Indicators related to primary production (PPR% and GE) and loss of secondary production ($L_{index}$) were much lower than the overall averages [@Pauly1995; @Libralato2008], suggesting that fisheries might have a low impact on the trophic structure of this ecosystem. As a comparison, the PPR% to maintain the consumption of cormorants was four times higher than all estuarine fisheries.

Indicators related to primary production (PPR% and GE) and loss of secondary production ($L_{index}$) were much lower than the overall averages , suggesting that fisheries might have a low impact on the trophic structure of this ecosystem. As a comparison, the PPR% to maintain the consumption of cormorants was five times higher than all estuarine fisheries.

## Time series analysis

The PEC model calibration resulted in a good fit despite the short time series.The landing data without changes in vulnerability (v=2) was the best fit found by the automated procedure, corroborating the mixed flow control identified by the mixed impact analyzes. The model was able to predict the decreasing trend in landings of crabs, pufferfishes, and mollusk, as well as the oscillations of shrimp. The ecosystem did not show significant changes in the fitting period of the model (2014-2018) since no significant trends were observed in any of the attributes used to evaluate temporal dynamics

Simulations’ outputs of changes in fishing effort showed that high TL groups react quickly to effort changes. The biomass increasing for intermediate groups was identified in the scenarios with increased fishing effort after 2023, an indirect effect of the predator reduction. On the other hand, groups of lower trophic levels (mainly invertebrates) seems not been impacted even in scenarios with fishing increasing.

The impact on the upper trophic levels is reinforced by the analysis of the results of the trends of ecological indicators (TLco, TLc, Kempton's Q) that show significant trends of decrease in scenarios with increased fishing effort. This change was not identified in the fisheries reduction scenario (Scenario 5), even though the functional groups of the higher TL groups showed biomass increase.
